## Pomodoro method and creating To-do List

The aim of the project is to build an app that can create and manage a to-do list using Pomodoro method. This app is inspired by Pomodoro Technique which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. In order to achieve this, we will use HTML / CSS / JavaScript. The project will be developed by using branches and project board on GitHub.
